# Button

I'm just playing with some websockets. Probably going to see how complicated I can get this!

You can visit a live demo of this site at [button.bryankendall.me](button.bryankendall.me).

### Notes

* Had to update nginx to 1.4.1 to get the websockets to forward properly
* Having trouble making the button a javascript object with a websocket as a member. `this` gets all sorts of confused
